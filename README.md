# Server-Side-Request-tool-v1
This is a *VERY* basic tool. Basically shows you server side request and HTML of website. Simple stuff.

<h2>To use for linux </h2>
<h4> 
<br> git clone https://github.com/Yawy637/Server-Side-Request-Tool-v1
<br> cd Server-Side-Request-Tool
<br> python ServerSideRequest.py
</h4>

For anything else, I have no idea lmao. Good luck :)
